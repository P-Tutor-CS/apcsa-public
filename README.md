## Curriculum Issues

TEALS will only continue making small corrections and critical updates to TEALS curricula. Please <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">open an issue</a> if you encounter things like factual, spelling, or grammatical errors, broken links, sequencing problems (topics needed before they are taught), or incomplete/missing materials.

## Giving feedback and asking questions about the curriculum

TEALS intends for our curricula to be starting points for teaching teams. We invite volunteers and classroom teachers using our curricula to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">fork</a> them as appopriate! If you'd like to suggest changes or additions to a curriculum be added to the master branch, please submit a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull request</a> containing your changes. As a best practice, each pull request should contain a singular atomic change.

For general curriculum-related questions and discussion not tied to a specific reported issue, we encourage everyone to actively participate in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> board for the corresponding curriculum.  This is a great place to share alternative lesson ideas, share pro-tips for implementation and differentiation, pacing advice, etc.
