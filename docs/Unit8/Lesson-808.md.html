Pacing Guide
------------
| Section                                  | Total Time |
|------------------------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance                 |       5min |
| Test review and reteach                  |      30min |
| Return Test/start homework assignment |      15min |

Procedure
---------
Return student grades before class begins or while students are completing the bellwork.

Do not return students’ Test before the review session, since you want to motivate students to
pay attention to the entire review, taking supplemental notes the entire time.

### Bell-work and Attendance `[5 minutes]`

### Test Review & Reteach `[30 minutes]`

1. If grades are low, invite the class to a discussion of what can be improved. With your
   co-teachers and/or TAs you should decide how to shift focus as the AP Test is right around the
   corner. With your students, you should follow the same post-mortem format as in other review
   units, but with the AP exam in mind.

   - Do your students want to focus on Section II Test taking strategies?

   - Perhaps they feel they need to drill quick-response Section I questions?

   - As a sanity-check, students should be reminded that they only have 1.5 minutes to solve each
     Section I question on the AP. If they are note near this pace, or if this is an unrealistic
     goal (due to language and/or reading barriers), decide as a class to focus on Test-taking
     strategies (skipping, guessing, process of elimination) to reduce anxiety and recoup some
     potentially lost points.

   Students can get very discouraged during this time of year. Inspire and amuse your class by
   pointing out old word walls or assignments (if you still have them up), showing students how far
   they have come since the beginning of the school year.

2. Walk the students through each question on the Test, glossing over questions that everyone
   answered correctly.

   - You can ask for students to volunteer answers, or call on students randomly. Make sure that
     students explain their logic when they answer. If a student gives an incorrect answer, the
     explanation will tell you what you need to re-teach or clarify.

   - Do not skip questions that everyone answered correctly, but do not spend more than the time it
     takes to read the question, and congratulate students’ correct answers.

3. Project a copy of each question as you review—this will help students recall the question/process
   the information.

4. Make sure that students are taking notes during the re-teach, reminding students that for
   homework, they will have an opportunity to win back some of the points on their exam.

5. For Section II-type questions, select a sample of student work (with any identifying information
   obscured), and work through the answer together as a class.

### Return Test/Start Homework Assignment `[15 minutes]`
At the end of class, if time allows, return the Test and allow students some time to begin their
homework assignment.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Encourage advanced students to take on additional programming challenges. One easy way to do this is
to assign Programming Projects from the blue pages at the end of each Chapter. Section 12.5 has an
excellent recursive graphics lab that would be a wonderful assignment for advanced students.

If you have a few students that are struggling with the class, choose these students to create your
classroom posters after school or for extra credit.
