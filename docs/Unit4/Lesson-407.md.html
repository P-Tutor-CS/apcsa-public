Procedure: Day 1
---------
To hook your class for today’s material, and if space and whiteboard setup allow, set up the
grudgeball “court” and scoreboard before class begins. Remind students that lecture content will be
tested during the game.

### Bell-work and Attendance `[5 minutes]`

### Introduction and note-taking `[10 minutes]`

1. Ask students to name some limitations of arrays: shifting values is an ordeal, adding elements
   requires forming a new, larger array and copying values over, deleting elements leaves empty,
   unused indexes.

2. Introduce the more flexible ArrayList (be sure to remind students that they need to `import
   java.util.ArrayList`):

   - Uses arrays to store values (fast random access)

   - The ArrayList class contains methods to make add, remove, and shift values easily.

   - ArrayList takes a type parameter to determine what kind of values it will use as elements:

     * `ArrayList<String>` stores a list of Strings.
     * `ArrayList<Point>` stores a list of Points.

   - If you forget to pass a parameter with the type you want the array to contain, the code won’t
     execute.

3. Construct an ArrayList of Strings to demonstrate syntax:

   **`ArrayList<String>`**` spongebob = new `**`ArrayList<String>`**`();`

   - Even though the notation looks a bit different, the syntax is fairly similar to what we’ve used
     in the past. `ArrayList<type>` is how we indicate the type—just like you’d use int when
     declaring a one dimensional or two dimensional array.

     `ArrayList<String> `**`spongebob`**` = new ArrayList<String>();`

   - This is the name of your ArrayList. It can be any non-keyword that you want to use.

     `ArrayList<String> spongebob = `**`new`**` ArrayList<String>();`

   - Ask students if they can tell you what the new keyword is for (we use the new keyword when
     constructing an object).

     `ArrayList<String> spongebob = new ArrayList<String>`**`()`**`;`

   - Whenever you see empty parentheses, it means that you’re not using parameters.
   
   - The ArrayList constructor ArrayList<>() constructs an empty list. 

4. Using Poster 4.7, review some of the methods you can use to manipulate ArrayLists. Add some
   `spongebob` elements to your `ArrayList`:

   ``` Java
   spongebob.add ("Patrick Star");
   spongebob.add ("Squidward Tentacles");
   spongebob.add ("Mr. Krabs");
   spongebob.add ("Pikachu");
   spongebob.add ("Sandy Cheeks");
   ```

   - Ask students for suggestions on how to print out this ArrayList, and ask them to predict the
     output:

     ``` Java
     System.out.println("Some of the characters on Spongebob are " + spongebob);
     ```

   - Students will probably notice that Pikachu is not a character in the Spongebob cartoon; ask them
     to refer to Poster 4.7 to suggest some code to remove Pikachu from the list:

     ``` Java
     spongebob.remove(3);    // Pikachu is stored at index 3
     ```

   - Now ask students to add another character from the show to the middle of the list, at index 3:

     ``` Java
     spongebob.add(3, "Plankton");
     ```

   - The first parameter 3 indicates the target location, and the second parameter `"Plankton"`
     indicates the String to be stored there.

     ```
     ["Patrick Star", "Squidward Tentacles", "Mr. Krabs", "Sandy Cheeks"]
     ```

     becomes

     ```
     ["Patrick Star", "Squidward Tentacles", "Mr. Krabs", "Plankton"]
     ```

4. Briefly review a few other useful `ArrayList` methods. Students will have an opportunity to
   practice (and you will have an opportunity to reteach if needed) during Grudgeball, so this can
   be a quick overview:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### ARRAYLIST METHODS OVERVIEW

##### To get an element from the `ArrayList` and print it
``` Java
System.out.println(spongebob.get(3));
```

##### Index Out of Bounds Exception
``` Java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException:
```

Since the indices for an ArrayList start at 0 and end at the number of elements  - 1, accessing an index value outside of this range will result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException being thrown.

##### To get the number of elements in the ArrayList and print it
``` Java
System.out.println(spongebob.size());
```

##### To add all the elements in the ArrayList
``` Java
int sum = 0;

for (int = 0; i < spongebob.size(); i++) {
    String s = spongebob.get(i);
    sum += s.length();
}
System.out.println("Total of lengths = " + sum);
```

Have students justify your code choices, and ask a student (or students) to trace the code and
narrate the steps for the class.

##### To replace an array element (no shifting)
``` Java
spongebob.set(3, "Plankton");
```

This would replace Pikachu with Plankton directly, without requiring the shifting of the array.

##### To clear an array
``` Java
spongebob.clear();
```

This removes all elements from the list and leaves null values at each index (it’s an empty array
now).

##### Enhanced for each loop
``` Java
ArrayList<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
intList.add(95);
intList.add(85);
int total = 0;
for (Integer value: intList)
{
    total = total + value;
}
System.out.println(total);
```

Changing the size of an ArrayList while traversing it using an enhanced for loop can result in a ConcurrentModificationException being thrown. Therefore, when using an enhanced for loop to traverse an ArrayList, you should not add or remove elements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Grudgeball `[35 minutes]`

1. Divide students into their assigned teams.

2. Review the rules for grudgeball, and have the students repeat the rules back to you.

3. Using the problems listed below (and any you may add, depending on your class’ needs), play
   grudgeball until a team wins, or until the class period ends.

   a. If a class gets the answer wrong, BRIEFLY pause the game to have students offer corrections
      before moving to the next team’s question.

   b. If correction seems to be dragging on, jump in and quickly re-teach using the incorrect answer
      as your example. It is important to keep the pace going to maintain student interest in the
      game!

Gudgeball problems & answers have been grouped assuming that you have 6 teams. If you have fewer
teams, each “round” will be shifted accordingly, so you may have rounds where different teams are
practicing different concepts. Judge each team’s knowledge gaps, and adjust which questions you ask
each group accordingly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### GRUDGEBALL PROBLEMS AND ANSWERS

_Use a type parameter to declare an ArrayList that:_

a. Stores a list of Strings → `ArrayList<String>`<br>
b. Stores a list of integers → `ArrayList<Integer>` (Wrapper class)<br>
c. Stores a list of Points → `ArrayList<Point>`<br>
d. Stores a list of doubles → `ArrayList<Double>` (Wrapper class)<br>
e. Stores a list of soccer teams → `ArrayList<String>`<br>
f. Stores a list of temperatures → `ArrayList<Double>` (Wrapper class)

_Construct an ArrayList:_

g. Called z that stores a list of ints → `ArrayList<int> z = new ArrayList<Integer>();`

h. Called list that stores a list of Strings → `ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();`

i. Called jose that stores a list of Points → `ArrayList<Point> jose = new ArrayList<Point>();`

j. Called pokemon that stores a list of Pokémon → `ArrayList<String> pokemon = new
   ArrayList<String>();`

k. Called metroCard that stores the number of metrocard rides each student has left on their card
   today → `ArrayList<Integer> metroCard = new ArrayList<Integer>();`

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
College Board Topic Questions
---------------------------------
After this lesson, students will be able to answer questions from the College Board Unit 7 Topic Questions 7.1 Introduction to ArrayList, 7.2 ArrayList Methods, and 7.3 Traversing ArrayList

Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classrooms, read the questions aloud in addition to showing the question on the board or
projector. Consider distributing a worksheet with the questions on it so students can write down
answers during the game.


Procedure Day 2
---------
Students will be introduced to a variety of ArrayLists algorithms.

The student lesson for Part 2 uses CS Awesomes [7.4. ArrayList Algorithms].  There you will
find the lesson plan and activities to check for student understanding. The teacher lesson plans are accessible by
joining the [Teaching CSAwesome google group][] and navigating to [Unit 7 Lesson 4 ArrayList Algorithms Lesson Plan][].

Common Mistakes
---------------
ArraysList common mistakes:
<http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/JavaReview/ListBasics/listMistakes.html>


Misconceptions
--------------
Java uses 3 different syntax for getting lengths which is a source of student confusion:

``` Java
String.length()
array.length
ArrayList.size()
```
