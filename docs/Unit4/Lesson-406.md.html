If the instruction takes longer than expected, assign the worksheet to small groups so students can
work together collaboratively. This should allow you to complete the lesson in one class period.
Alternatively, you can assign students to finish the worksheet at home for homework, or make the
worksheet shorter.


Procedure Day 1
---------
There are several ways you can teach today’s class. You should first check in with your students to
see how prepared they are for today’s lesson. If students understood most of what they read for
homework last night, you can ask students for specific questions, cover only those topics, then move
on to the Round-Robin activity. If your class is mostly confused, you can re-teach all of the
content, working through several examples with Think Pair Shares before breaking into the Round
Robin Activity. An optional Programming Challenge is included at the end of the lesson if your
lesson finishes early.

### Bell-work and Attendance `[5 minutes]`

### Introduction/Review of Objects & String Processing `[10 minutes]`

---

#### Emphasize with students...

#### Content - Advanced programming structures - Uses of pre-built data structures

Multidimensional arrays have quite a few uses. They can serve as grids for seating plans or for board games such as chess and checkers. Some students enjoy recreating the game of battleship using two dimensional arrays.

As you learn about their use, remember to consider how you might use multidimensional arrays in your future projects.

---

1. Two dimensional arrays come in handy when tracking certain types of data; adjust the explanation
   so it’s relevant to your students (a grocery store, a Starbucks, a farmer’s market).

   - Previously, we might have used an array to keep track of sandwich orders in line at a bodega:

     <img src="media/figure-406a.png" width="50%" />

   - Suppose we have several workers at the bodega making sandwiches, and we want to keep track of
     the orders each one is working on. We could use multiple arrays, or an array of arrays.

     <img src="media/figure-406b.png" width="50%" />

   - To traverse multidimensional arrays, we need a new tool to help us fill them.

2. Demonstrate a basic nested loop used to switch numbers in an array. Begin by using the array
   whiteboard to demonstrate what you want the code to do:

   <img src="media/figure-406c.png" width="25%" />

   - Challenge the students to come up with pseudocode (or actual code, if they’re ready for it)
     that prints out all of the inversions in this array. An inversion is a pair of numbers in which
     the first number in the list is greater than the second number. Be sure to emphasize that no
     elements are being moved or shifted. The output for the array above would be:

     ```
     (4, 3)
     (4, 2)
     (4, 1)
     (3, 2)
     (3, 1)
     (2, 1)
     ```

   - An array

     <img src="media/figure-406d.png" width="25%" />

     would output:

     ```
     (3, 1)
     (3, 2)
     (4, 2)
     ```

3. As your students are working on this problem, encourage them to use the whiteboard arrays to
   organize their thoughts and visualize the problem. Their pseudocode should look something like
   this:

   ```
   for (every possible first value) {
       for (every possible second value) {
           if (first value > second value) {
               print (first, second).
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - As a whole group, or in individual groups (depending on familiarity with the material),
     construct the final code:

     ``` Java
     for (int i = 0; i < data.length - 1; i++) {
         for (int j = i + 1; j < data.length; j++) {
             if (data[i] > data[j]) {
                 System.out.println ("(" + data[i] + ", " + data[j] + ")");
             }
         }
     }
     ```

   As a “Tricky Code Cheat Sheet” tip, you might discuss the general reminder that for an inversion,
   the second value has to appear after the first value in the list. This means that you only want
   to compare values that come after the first value, so the inner loop initializes at `j = i + 1`.

   If students ask why the outer loop ends at `data.length – 1`, have them trace the code and
   predict output using their whiteboards. They should notice that since only pairs of numbers are
   being compared, the last element of the array will never be a possible first value.

4. Ask a volunteer student to help you build a physical representation of a multidimensional array
   (an array of arrays). Demonstrate the code used to create arrays of multiple dimensions, and have
   students gather array whiteboards from around the room to show what the arrays would look like in
   memory:

   - `double`: one double value

     <img src="media/figure-406e.png" width="8%" />

   - `double[]`: a 1 dimensional array of doubles

     <img src="media/figure-406f.png" width="25%" />

   - `double[][]`: a 2 dimensional array (grid) of doubles

     <img src="media/figure-406g.png" width="25%" />

   - `double[][][]`: a 3 dimensional array (cube) of doubles

     <img src="media/figure-406h.png" width="25%" />

   - An array constructed with the code below has 2 rows and 3 columns:

     ```
     double[][] ages = new double[2][3];
     ```

     Have students index the array for you:

     <img src="media/figure-406i.png" width="25%" />

   - You might opt to give students this general formula for the syntax of declaring and
     constructing a multidimensional array:

     <img src="media/figure-406a.png" width="50%" />

5. Run through some examples with your students:

   - To access the 1<sup>st</sup> element of the 2<sup>nd</sup> row: `ages[1][0]`

   - To access all elements of the 1<sup>st</sup> row: `ages[0]`

   - To access all elements of the 2<sup>nd</sup> row: `ages[1]`

6. Multidimensional arrays can also be passed as parameters. Have students trace the flow of control
   and predict the output of the code below:

   ``` Java
   public static void print (double[][] grid) {
       for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
               System.out.print(grid[i][j] + " ");
           }
           System.out.println();
       }
   }
   ```

   - Ask students why you referenced `grid.length` in the outer loop (the number of rows), and what
     `grid[i].length` refers to (the number of columns).

   - As a final tip, let students know that for multidimensional arrays, `Arrays.toString` won’t
     work correctly, and they should use `Arrays.deepToString` instead.

### Round Robin `[45 minutes]`

1. Round-robin is a drilling and error-checking exercise used with worksheets. At minimum, there
   should be 1 question for each student (_e.g._ a class of 15 students would need a worksheet with
   15 or more questions). Students write their name on the worksheet, complete the first problem,
   then pass the paper to the student on the right (or whatever direction you choose). The next
   student first checks the previous answer, correcting it if need be, then completes the second
   question. Each student then passes on the paper again. By the end of the exercise, each student
   has checked and completed each question on the worksheet.

2. The hook is that you choose only ONE worksheet from the pile to grade. All students get a grade
   from that one worksheet. This keeps students invested throughout the exercise. Advanced students
   will check questions throughout the whole worksheet, and all students will try their best to
   catch their own (and others’) mistakes, since the whole class shares the
   randomly-selected-paper’s grade.

3. You should time each question/checking interval, and call “TIME!” when it is time for students to
   pass along papers.

   a. Questions 1–4 should take ≈1 minute each.<br>
   b. Questions 5–9 should take ≈2 minutes each.<br>
   c. Questions 10–12 should take ≈3 minutes each.<br>
   d. Questions 13–14 should take ≈4 minutes each.<br>
   e. Questions 15–16 [Bonus] should take ≈5 minutes each.

   Adjust the timing on these questions as needed, but try to keep a brisk pace. Part of the
   engagement factor is the sense of urgency.

### Paper Selection & Grade Announcement `[3 minutes]`
If time allows, randomly select the worksheet and announce the class grade with a bit of fanfare,
congratulating the class on a job well done. If there are any incorrect answers, use the time at the
end of class to review the correct solutions or take questions.

College Board Topic Questions
---------------------------------
After this lesson, students will be able to answer questions from the College Board Unit 8 Topic Questions 8.1 2D Arrays and 8.2 Traversing 2D Arrays

Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
To optimize this exercise, you might consider rearranging students (or creating a passing-path) that
mixes students of different coding abilities. The advanced students can use the extra time to
correct mistakes made by others; if they are sitting in proximity to the student that made the
error, they will have a better chance of explaining the correct answer to them.

Due to the brisk pace of the round-robin rotation, there shouldn’t be too much down time for any one
student. If your students are finishing faster than the time intervals indicated, reduce the amount
of time allotted to maintain a sense of urgency/keep students on task. If finished early, offer a
Programming Challenge while you grade the sample worksheet.
