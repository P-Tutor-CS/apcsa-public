### About Barron’s
- Barron’s is an AP CS A review book that some schools provide students. If your school doesn’t
  provide Barron’s there are many alternative homework assignments that can be found at
  codingbat.com/java

- Alternatively, you can save time spent on the lab by checking activities as homework.

### General Project Notes
1. To help students start the lab smoothly, start Activity 1 as a whole group.

2. Encourage students to use their Tricky Code Cheat Sheets, 4 Commandments of Scope, notebooks,
   textbooks, classroom posters, and homework assignments.

3. Offer occasional time-checks to help keep students on pace.

4. Grade notebooks and review books in between helping students so students can keep notebooks for
   homework and studying in the evenings.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classrooms, read all directions aloud before breaking into individual practice, and allow up
to twice the amount of time for completion of the lab.

- To save time on the rest of the lab, don’t spend too much time reviewing binary numbers, and
  restrict color exploration (Activity 2) to ~20 minutes.

- Use the tactile exercises as suggested on page 6 of the Teacher’s guide (candy exercise and
  exploring the digital camera).

As needed, allow students to pair up to help each other with reading comprehension (but remind
students that they each must submit their own code). Each day that you begin the lab, start with a
quick survey of student concerns and questions.

Assessment questions have been relocated to the practice exam, WS 5.7.
