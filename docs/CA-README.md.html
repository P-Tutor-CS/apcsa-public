Aligning TEALS APCSA Teaching Resources with the BC Curriculum
--------

This course focuses on object-oriented programming and problem solving in Java. The intended use is for schools offering AP College Board’s Computer Science A course. For schools in BC, Canada, the course can be adapted to align with BC’s grade 12 [Computer Programming](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/12/computer-programming) or [Computer Science](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/12/computer-science) courses. Since 2018, our community partner BCIT has been supporting the curriculum alignment work. Here are highlights of the changes:

* added Culture Days
* created alternative projects for Unit 1-5
* incorprated BC's core competencies: communication, creative and critical thinking, personal and social responsibilities
* added components of BC's learning standards: big ideas, curricular competencies and content

For Computer Programming 12 (Applied Design, Skills and Technologies)
--------
#### Curricular Competencies
* Curricular competencies under Applied Skills, such as  ideating, prototyping and testing, are incorporated into the alternative projects and throughout the course.
* Activities involved conducting user-centred research are added to the course.

For Computer Science 12 (Mathematics)
--------
#### Content
* Unit 3 alternative project Calculator is added to the course
