### About Barron’s
- Barron’s is an AP CS A review book that some schools provide students. If your school doesn’t
  provide Barron’s there are many alternative homework assignments that can be found at
  codingbat.com/java.

- Alternatively, you can save time spent on the lab by checking activities as homework.

### General Project Notes
Before letting students begin the projects, ask students what resources are available to them so
they can help themselves before calling you over. (Notebooks, textbook, class handouts, student work
and posters hanging around the room, online resources.

- If you’ve chosen to introduce TextExcel earlier, you can assign portions of TextExcel as homework
  here to save time later in the course. TextExcel like FracCalc takes a lot of in and out of class
  time to complete, and time saved here saves time for AP test review.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classrooms, read all directions aloud before breaking into individual practice, and allow up
to twice the amount of time for completion of the lab.

- To save time on the rest of the lab, don’t spend too much time reviewing binary numbers, and
  restrict color exploration (Activity 2) to ~20 minutes.

- Use the tactile exercises as suggested on page 6 of the Teacher’s guide (candy exercise and
  exploring the digital camera).

As needed, allow students to pair up to help each other with reading comprehension (but remind
students that they each must submit their own code). Each day that you begin the lab, start with a
quick survey of student concerns and questions.
