### About Barron’s
- Barron’s is an AP CS A review book that some schools provide students. If your school doesn’t
  provide Barron’s there are many alternative homework assignments that can be found at
  codingbat.com/java

- Alternatively, you can save time spent on the lab by checking activities as homework.

### General Project Notes
- Open IDE and guide students through opening the Steganography files.

- Encourage students to use their Tricky Code Cheat Sheets, 4 Commandments of Scope, notebooks,
  textbooks, classroom posters, and homework assignments.

- Offer occasional time-checks to help keep students on pace.

- Grade notebooks and review books in between helping students so students can keep notebooks for
  homework and studying in the evenings.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classrooms, read all directions aloud before breaking into individual practice, and allow up
to twice the amount of time for completion of the lab. As needed, allow students to pair up to help
each other with reading comprehension (but remind students that they each must submit their own
code). Each day that you begin the lab, start with a quick survey of student concerns and questions.
